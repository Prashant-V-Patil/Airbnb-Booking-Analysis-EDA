# Airbnb-Booking-Analysis-EDA

Overview

Airbnb has been a popular platform since 2008, allowing guests and hosts to explore unique traveling possibilities and personalized experiences. Millions of listings generate data that is crucial for the company to make business decisions, understand customer and host behaviors, implement new services, and more. The dataset for this project contains around 49,000 observations, including both categorical and numeric values.

The goal of this project is to explore and analyze the dataset to gain insights and answer various questions, such as understanding different hosts and areas, analyzing room types and their prices, identifying busy hosts, and finding the correlation between different variables.
